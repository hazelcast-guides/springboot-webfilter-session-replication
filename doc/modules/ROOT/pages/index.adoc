= Session Replication with Spring Boot and Hazelcast

This guide will get you started to use Hazelcast as for the Spring Boot session replication.

include::{templates-url}/link-to-repo.adoc[]

== What You’ll Learn

In this guide, you'll deploy a Spring Boot application which uses Hazelcast for sessions replication.

== Prerequisites

- ~5 minutes
- JDK 1.8+
- Apache Maven 3.2+

== Spring Boot Application

In our case, let's have a simple web application with the following controller and HTML template.

.WebController.java
[source,java]
----
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/")
public class WebController {

    @RequestMapping(value = "/")
    public String index(HttpSession httpSession) {
        Integer hits = (Integer) httpSession.getAttribute("hits");
        if (hits == null) {
            hits = 0;
        }
        httpSession.setAttribute("hits", ++hits);

        return "index";
    }
}
----

.index.html
[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
	<body>
		<h3>Session Id</h3>
		<p th:text="${#httpSession.id}"/>
		<h3>Hits</h3>
		<p th:text="${#httpSession.getAttribute('hits')}"/>
	</body>
</html>
----

When you start the application and open the browser at http://localhost:8080, you should see an information with the current session ID and the number of hits (number of times you refreshed the browser).

Now, the problem is that if you start two instances of your application, then the counts for each of them would be completely separate. That is because each Spring Boot application replica stores it's sessions separately. What's more, if one of the application crashes, the session data is lost. That is what we want to change with the use of Hazelcast.

== Using Hazelcast for Sessions Replication

To use Hazelcast for session replication in your Spring Boot application, you need to:

- add `hazelcast-all` dependency
- add Hazelcast configuration
- add `WebFilter` configuration bean

Here are the added parts in `pom.xml` and `Application.java`.

.pom.xml
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-all</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.2</version>
</dependency>
----

.Application.java
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public Config config() {
    return new Config();
}

@Bean
public WebFilter webFilter(HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance) {

    Properties properties = new Properties();
    properties.put("instance-name", hazelcastInstance.getName());
    properties.put("sticky-session", "false");

    return new WebFilter(properties);
}
----

This way, we defined Hazelcast configuration and used the embedded Hazelcast instance to enable session replication.

== Starting the Application

To start two replicas of the application, run the following commands.

----
mvn spring-boot:run
SERVER_PORT=8081 mvn spring-boot:run
----

You should see in the logs that both embedded Hazelcast instances formed one cluster.

]
----

== Testing the Application

Open the browser at http://localhost:8080. You should see the following content.

Now, open the browser at http://localhost:8081. You should see that the hit has increased.

That means that both applications share the same session data store.

== What's more?

Spring Boot is really well integrated with Hazelcast. You can check the other guide https://github.com/hazelcast-guides/springboot-caching[Caching with Spring Boot and Hazelcast]. You can also set up your Hazelcast in the client-server topology instead of using embedded Hazelcast.
